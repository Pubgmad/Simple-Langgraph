# LangGraph Random Sports Selector

This is a simple workflow built using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) that randomly selects between **Badminton** and **Tennis**.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a conditional flow in LangGraph using basic Python logic. It randomly picks one of two sports — Badminton or Tennis — and outputs the result. This serves as a minimal working example of using LangGraph for decision-based workflows.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- LangGraph
- LangChain (optional, if integrated)
- Python `random` module

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pubgmad/Simple-Langgraph.git
   cd Simple-Langgraph
